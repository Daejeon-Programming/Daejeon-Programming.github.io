<!-- 

This is a template of a profile page to give you some idea about what you write here. This is just an example, the goal is not  to give you some limitation or rules.

Also if you're beginer with html I would recommand writting everything by yourself as an exercise.

Here you can write whatever you want and express all your creativity. And it is recommended to do so.

  <p>I'm being lazy right now so I won't write much in this template. Just consider it as a first sketch that will be completed later.<br/> Also, You can add a css file which name is the same as your html profile page ('name'.css). Right now there is no style at all so it'll just look boring...</p>

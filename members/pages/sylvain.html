      <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
      <section>I'm a french mechanical engineer (or at least I graduated as one), after my Masters degree I worked for one year as a patent engineer in Paris. Because I was a bit bored and felt like that was a good time for me to try to "follow my dream", I decided to leave my comfort and to take one year off to study programming by myself. To make the whole experience even more interesting, I decided to go to live in Korea during this year (I already knew Korea from a year as an exchange student).<br/> For this year of studying, I had (and still have somehow) the project to develop a 'language exchange app' for smartphone. This idea was also a good reason to live in a foreign country.</section>

      <h2>What were my programming experience at that point ?</h2>
      <section>Before last September (2016), I had little experience with programming, but never anything very serious. I took some of the opportunity, during high school and college to participate in school projects that involved programming, but I never gave any priority to studying this.<br/> So during these projects I learned basic html and css, I tried learning C a few time, but always stopped in the middle because of a lack of motivating goals. In university I had a big project where the theme my group picked was "Develop an Android app." For for this project I learned how to use an Arduino board. And that's all I knew at that point.</section>

      <h2>What did I learn since ?</h2>
      <section>The fist thing I learned once I arrived in Korea (after I realized that my project might be a big mistake) is Java, because as far as I knew it was the main language use for Android apps... And it seems like a good beginning point. Once I felt a bit more confident with it, I began to take a look at how Android works... And I got a bit lost. After a while, I took the decision that maybe I should rework on my html/css knowledge and ended up feeling like web design and a web app would be way easier for a beginning... I learnt JavaScript and PHP, then I had a few small projects with it. Around Christmas I visited my friends and family in France, one of my friends told me that he was working in a startup in Canada, using node.js for his app. I told him that maybe I could help him. And so I began to learn node.js. Nowadays I'm finally able to help him with his app by writing some tests. I haven't continued my 'language exchange app' project recently, but still think about it... Recently I was thinking that I should probably find some people to build a project, that's why David's idea to have some project together motivate me so much.</section>

      <h2>About me outside of programming</h2>
      <section>Well, you already know that I'm French... I'm 24 years old. In the sport topic... I'm not very athletic, but I really like mountaineering in all its aspects (hiking, alpinisme, rock climbing). I'm very curious about science, and culture in general, so I spend way too much time listening/watching video/podcast on the internet. A few years ago I used to watch a lot of movies... but nowadays I have calmed down. I still like a good movie though. The same thing happened with manga and animation... I still binge watch a series once in a while though. About music, I'm not very original, I like any kind and especially to discover new styles. I'm always up for a discussion about a random philosophical/scientific topic around a beer.</section>

      <h2>A bit more detail on the 'language exchange app'</h2>
      <section>This idea came to me as I was learning Korean, when chatting with some Korean friends, sometime, I was trying to speak Korean with them. I knew that my Korean was full of mistakes and weirdly constructed sentences, but they would almost never correct these. I don't think that it's because they didn't want to help or just had no time to do this...<br/> My analysis is that 'normal' messenger apps are not suitable for multilingual conversation because it's hard and annoying to keep a conversation alive and to correct mistakes or give advice about a language at the same time.</section>
